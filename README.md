# Ojan-Energy
## Introduction
In this project we are developing an energy management system that will enable real-time monitoring of energy consumption within commercial and industrial facilities. This will provide building owners and facility managers with a centralized visibility into the energy consumption patterns which can be analysed to increase efficiency and cut down their energy costs by 10-20%. It will also provide asset health data that will enable predictive maintenance through automated alerts to avoid future equipment breakdown again saving them on costs. Overall this will improve the facilitiesâ€™ electrical health and safety.

## Dataset
We made use of the Microsoft Azure DataSet that can be used for predictive maintenance.

## Approach
Using the data collected from the sensors, we will make predictions for the next possible failure date using the LSTM Model.
